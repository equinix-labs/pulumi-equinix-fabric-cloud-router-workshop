# Introduction

## About Equinix Labs

Equinix Labs offers workshops, proof of concepts, and tools for exploring and bootstrapping Equinix digital infrastructure including Fabric, Metal, and Network Edge.

## About the workshop

Welcome to the workshop on provisioning Equinix infrastructure using Pulumi. Throughout this workshop, we will explore the capabilities of Pulumi, leveraging its versatility through multi-language and multi-cloud support. Our demonstration will focus on utilizing a Pulumi template written in Python to establish a private connection from a new Equinix Fabric Cloud Router to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We will utilize the Pulumi providers for Equinix and GCP.

In this workshop, we'll seamlessly take advantage of a cloud provider SDK to use capabilities not present in the corresponding Terraform or Pulumi providers offered by the cloud provider.

The goals of this workshop are:
  
* How to use Pulumi and Equinix together
* Defining and deploying Equinix resources using popular programming languages
* Establishing a private interconnection to a Cloud Service Provider
* How to extend the functionality of Pulumi providers
