# Conclusion

Thank you for participating in the workshop! Let's recap some of the key takeways that we've learned:

* We have explored how to provision Equinix infrastructure using Pulumi, harnessing its flexibility and power
* We've learned how to overcome limitations in providers by integrating with external APIs and SDKs, thereby extending the automation capabilities of Pulumi.
* Additionally, we've highlighted that while this example utilizes Python, similar outcomes can be achieved with any of the other supported languages (Java, .NET, TypeScript, Go).
* By embracing tools like Pulumi, we empower ourselves to streamline and automate our infrastructure deployment processes efficiently.

## Next Steps

* As a next step, we encourage exploring the integration of Equinix Fabric Cloud Router with other cloud service providers to further unlock its potential. By adding interconnections to additional cloud environments, such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can evaluate the agility and efficiency of Equinix Fabric in facilitating cross-cloud traffic routing without the need for additional configuration.
